                <p>When we first laid eyes on the dresser, it stood quietly in a dim corner of an old estate sale—dust-covered, water-stained, and forgotten. But beneath the surface, we could see the potential: the solid oak frame, the hand-carved drawer fronts, and the aged brass handles all whispered stories of a different era. This was no ordinary piece. It was a survivor of the 1920s—a time of jazz, art deco, and fine American craftsmanship.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p> The process began with a careful assessment. We found that while the frame was structurally sound, decades of neglect had taken their toll on the finish and detailing. Our team started by gently stripping the worn varnish, revealing the rich oak grain hidden underneath. We preserved as much of the original patina as possible—because character matters. The dresser didn’t need to look “brand new,” it needed to look beautifully aged. Each drawer was meticulously realigned. The hardware was cleaned using a mild vinegar soak and soft brush to maintain its aged brass charm.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>After weeks of loving restoration, the oak dresser emerged with a new glow. Its deep honey tones returned. The detailing stood proud once again. And that gentle creak when opening the top drawer? We left it. Some things are worth keeping. Today, this dresser isn’t just furniture—it’s a statement. It’s a reminder that beauty doesn’t fade, it just waits to be rediscovered.</p><br>
